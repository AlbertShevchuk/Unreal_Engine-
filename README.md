Health Bar with % indicator. Constant smooth Health Regeneration when entering selected areas.  --4/24/2020

Health Regen, Health Degen altered. Armor animation (just like health) added to HUD. Armor is 
set to always increase slowly. Damage taken decreases from armor first then from health. Blood 
splatter vignette animation added to screen when receiving damage. Pause screen upon “Esc” key 
added with “RESUME” and “QUIT” functioning buttons. “Game Over” screen added when health reached 
to 0% with added “RETRY” and “QUIT” functioning buttons. Converted game to a 3rd shooter instead 
of a 1st shooter to get the full body of the player instead of just a floating arm. Moved up the 
camera and manipulated the image to look back like a 1st shooter.    –4/25/2020
